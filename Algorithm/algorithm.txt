## An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem.


## Characteristic of a good Algorithm
    - Input : zero or multiple inputs
    - Output : At least one Output  is produce.
    - Definiteness : Each step is precisely define.
    - Finiteness : The algorithm must terminate after a finite number of steps.
    - Effectiveness : Each step is simple enough to be carried out in a finite amount of time.

## Why algorithm Matters
    - Efficiency :
    - Scalability :
    - Problem solving  : fundamental of solving Complex Programming  Problems
