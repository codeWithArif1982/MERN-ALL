游릴 Importance of Data Structure :
   - Efficiency
   - Organization
   - Scalability

游릴 Common Data Structure :
   - Array : Ordered collection of elements.
   - Linked Lists : Elements Connected by pointers.
   - Stacks : Last In First Out (LIFO) Structure.
   - Queues : First In First Out (FIFO) Structure.
   - Trees : Hierarchical Structure.
   - Graphs : Network of nodes and edges.
   - Hash Tables : Key-value pairs.

游릴 Time Space TradeOff

游릴 Types of Data Structure :
    - Primitive Data Structures :  Basic building blocks (int, float, char).
    - Non-Primitive Data Structures : Derived from Primitive data structure (Array, Lists)

    - Liner Data Structures : Elements are stored in a linear sequence (arrays, linked lists).
    - Non-Liner Data Structures : Elements are not in a sequence (Trees, Graphs).

游릴 Operations on Data Structures :
    - Traversal : Visiting each elements.
    - Insertion : Adding elements.
    - Deletion : Remove elements.
    - Search : Finding an elements.
    - Sorting : Arranging elements in a specific order.
    - Merging : Combining two data structures.
