üü© String :
    - A string is a sequence of characters, typically used to represent text or other form of data.
    - Define as array of characters.
    - Difference between character array and string is the string is terminated with a special character '\0'
    - Some language, String are implemented as array of character, making them a derived data type.
    -String are commonly used for sorting and manipulating textual data.

üü© Operations on String:
    - Concatenation:
        * Joining two strings together to create a new string .
    - Length:
        * Determining the number of characters in a string.
    - Access:
        * Accessing individual characters in a string by index.
    - Comparison:
        * Comparing two strings lexicographically or to check for equality or order.
    - Substring extraction:
        * Extracting a substring from a string.
    - Search:
        * Finding the position of a specific substring within a string.
    - Modification:
        * Changing or replacing characters within a string.

üü© Applications of String:

Plagiarism Checker: Strings can be used to find Plagiarism in codes, and contents in a very little amount of time using string matching algorithms. Using this the computer could easily tell us the percentage of code, and text written by any two users matches by how much percent.
Encoding/Decoding(Cipher Text Generation): Strings can be used for encoding and decoding for the safe transfer of data from sender to receiver to make sure no one in the way of transmission gets to read your data as they could perform both active and passive attacks. The text you transfer as a message gets ciphered at the sender‚Äôs end and decoded at the receiver‚Äôs end.
Information Retrieval: String applications help us to retrieve information from unknown data sources( large datasets used as input) along with the help of string matching/retrieval module helps us to retrieve important information.
Improved Filters For The Approximate Suffix-Prefix Overlap Problem: Strings and its algorithms applications help us to provide improved Filters for the Approximate Suffix-Prefix Overlap Problem. The approximate suffix-prefix overlap problem is to find all pairs of strings from a given set such that a prefix of one string is similar to a suffix of the other.
Network communication: Strings are used to encode and decode data sent over networks, such as HTTP requests and responses.
File handling: Strings are used to manipulate file paths and names, and to read and write files.
Data analysis: Strings can be used to extract meaningful insights from large amounts of text data, such as natural language processing and sentiment analysis.
Real-Time Application of String:

Spam Detection: Strings can be used to serve as a spam detection system as the concept of string matching algorithm will be applied here. Spam (unwanted emails) could cause great financial loss. All the spam filters use the concept of string matching to identify and discard the spam.
Bioinformatics: Strings can be used in the field of Bioinformatics( DNA sequencing). String matching module can be used to solve issues or problems regarding genetic sequences and to find the patterns in DNA.
Intrusion Detection System: Strings can be used in intrusion detection systems. Packets that contain intrusion related keywords are found by applying string matching algorithms.
Search Engines: Strings can be used in many search engine techniques. Most of the data are available on the internet in the form of textual data. Due to huge amount of uncategorized text data, it becomes really difficult to search a particular content. Web search engines organize the data and to categorize the data string matching algorithms are used.
   Operations on String:

String provides users with various operations. Some of the important ones are:

size(): This function is used to find the length of the string.
substr(): This is used to find a substring of length a particular length starting from a particular index.
+: This operator is used to concatenate two strings.
s1.compare(s2): This is used to compare two strings s1 and s2 to find which is lexicographically greater and which one is smaller.
reverse(): This function is used to reverse a given string. 
sort(): This function is used to sort the string in lexicographic order.

Advantages of String:

Text Processing: Strings are used to represent text in programming languages. They can be used to manipulate and process text in various ways, such as searching, replacing, parsing, and formatting.
Data Representation: Strings can be used to represent other data types, such as numbers, dates, and times. For example, you can use a string to represent a date in the format ‚ÄúYYYY-MM-DD‚Äù, or a time in the format ‚ÄúHH:MM:SS‚Äù.
Ease of Use: Strings are easy to use and manipulate. They can be concatenated, sliced, and reversed, among other things. They also have a simple and intuitive syntax, making them accessible to programmers of all skill levels.
Compatibility: Strings are widely used across programming languages, making them a universal data type. This means that strings can be easily transferred between different systems and platforms, making them a reliable and efficient way to communicate and share data.
Memory Efficiency: Strings are usually stored in a contiguous block of memory, which makes them efficient to allocate and deallocate. This means that they can be used to represent large amounts of data without taking up too much memory.
    Disadvantages of String:

Memory Consumption: Strings can consume a lot of memory, especially when working with large strings or many strings. This can be a problem in memory-constrained environments, such as embedded systems or mobile devices.
Immutability: In many programming languages, strings are immutable, meaning that they cannot be changed once they are created. This can be a disadvantage when working with large or complex strings that require frequent modifications, as it can lead to inefficiencies and memory overhead.
Performance Overhead: String operations can be slower than operations on other data types, especially when working with large or complex strings. This is because string operations often involve copying and reallocating memory, which can be time-consuming.
Encoding and Decoding Overhead: Strings can have different character encodings, which can lead to overhead when converting between them. This can be a problem when working with data from different sources or when communicating with systems that use different encodings.
Security Vulnerabilities: Strings can be vulnerable to security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows or injection attacks, if not handled properly. This is because strings can be manipulated by attackers to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive data.
